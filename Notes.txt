Operating systems are designed around three core concepts:
Virtualization
Concurrency 
Persistence

Virtualization:
The OS virtualizes physical resources (CPU, memory, disks) such that each process thinks that they have exclusive access to these resources (virtual address space)


Concurrency:
When multiple processes are in progress at the same time 
Threads are functions that share memory â€“ functions that run independently but share the same data


Persistence:
Saving data so it stays around even after the computer is turned off 
The software in the operating system that usually manages the disk is called the file system
the OS does not create a private, virtualized disk for each application
Open, close, and write are the system calls to access the disk safely
